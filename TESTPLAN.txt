We used a variety of testing methods. Most code was tested as it was written. Upon finishing a 
class, unit testing was done through writing a JUnit test file for that class. Manual testing was
heavily employed as well, especially in the text-based user interface, and the end system for which
all possible scenarios were played out as best as possible (see UserInterfaceTest.txt for more 
details).

Once each component was verified to be fairly stable on a stand-alone basis, integration testing 
was used to ensure that the system could work as a whole.


ClassDBTest.java -- tests adding and deleting classrooms, threads, and comments from ClassDB objects. Classes used
were ClassDB.java, ClassRoom.java, and Post.java.

ClassListTest.java -- tests adding and removing ClassData objects from ClassList objects.

Client.java -- 

ClientSocketHandler.java -- 

Cookie.java --  

Hub.java --  tests for creating a Hub correctly. Most tests were integration testing with a client and server.

HubSocketHandler.java -- Most tests were integration tests with a client, hub, and server.

Message.java -- tests for creating Cookies and setting fields of the message.

Server.java -- tests for creating a Server correctly. Most tests were integration testing with a client and hub.

ServerListTest.java -- Tests added and deleting servers from ServerList objects. 

ServerSocketHandler.java -- Most tests were integration tests with a client, hub, and server.

UserInterface.java -- The bulk of the testing for the user interface is outlined extensively in 
UserInterfaceTest.txt. UserInterfaceTest.java contains JUnit tests methods for the helper functions.

UserListTest.java -- Tests added deleting and validating users from UserList objects.
