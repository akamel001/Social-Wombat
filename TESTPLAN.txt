Testcases:








=================

Julia:
Since there is no good framework for testing text-based console user interfaces, 
I decided to create my own manual test suite, which is documented here.

Things to test:
* All necessary parts of a page get displayed (page name, messages, info, content, options, question)
* The proper content is displayed in each part of the page. Specifically:
	* A user sees the correct pages depending on his permission status (instructor, teaching assistant, or student)
	* Current info is updated and not stale
