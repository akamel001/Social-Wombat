We used a variety of testing methods. Most code was tested as it was written. Upon finishing a 
class, unit testing was done through writing a JUnit test file for that class. Manual testing was
heavily employed as well, especially in the text-based user interface, for which all possible 
scenarios were played out as best as possible.

Once each component was verified to be fairly stable on a stand-alone basis, integration testing 
was used to ensure that the system could work as a whole.
